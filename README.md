# Mapping

Mapping is a module for Omeka S which allows you to geolocate Omeka S items and
add interactive maps to your sites and pages.

See the [Omeka S user manual](http://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/mapping/){target=_blank}
for user documentation.

Mapping has no dependencies, except the Timeline feature, which requires [Numeric Data Types](https://omeka.org/s/modules/NumericDataTypes/){target=_blank} to be installed and applied to date fields. 

The Mapping module adds metadata fields to each item, a "Mapping" tab to item editing, and several batch-editing options for items. It also adds:
- optional location-based search fields to the advanced search pages on the admin and public interfaces
- three page blocks to Site Pages that can display maps and timelines for browsing: "Map by query", "Map by attachments", and "Map by groups"
- a "Map Browse" page for each site, found in the Site Navigation settings
- resource blocks to items and item sets, which can be repositioned within the regions offered by a given site's theme.

Mapping has no global configuration settings. Item sets cannot be geolocated, but can display mapping information based on items assigned to them.
